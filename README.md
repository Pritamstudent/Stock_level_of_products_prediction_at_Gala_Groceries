# Stock level of products prediction at Gala Groceries
This is the project under the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience Program at Forage by Cognizant.
## The steps involved in building the project are given below:
### 1) Exploratory Data Analysis
- Exploring customer data to identify next steps
- Used google colab to do the exploratory data analysis
- Aim to have a solid understanding of the statistical properties of the dataset when you’re complete.
- Finally, you must summarize your findings in a concise and business-friendly manner within an email to the Data Science team leader. 
- Skills gained: __Data Analysis | Python Data | Visualization__

- Link to email doc: [email](https://github.com/Pritamstudent/Stock_level_of_products_prediction_at_Gala_Groceries/blob/master/Email.docx)
### 2)Data Modeling
- Understanding relational data and framing a problem statement
- Come up with a plan as to how you’ll use this data to solve the problem statement that the client has positioned. 
- Summarize the data that you want to make use of and the strategic plan of action in a single PowerPoint slide.

### 3)Model Building and Interpretation
- Building a predictive model and interpreting the results back to the business.
- The client has provided 3 datasets, it is now your job to combine, transform and model these datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement that the business has requested. 
- We will use RandomForesrRegressor as the ML model and will also use cross-validation
- Once you’re done with the modeling, summarize your results in a business-friendly single PowerPoint slide.

- Skills learnt: __Machine Learning | Model Interpretation | Communication__
### 4) Machine Learning Production
- Developing machine learning algorithms for production
- Be sure to write good quality code, this means following best practices and writing your code in a clear and uniform manner. 
- Furthermore, make sure to document your code with comments, as this will help the ML engineering team to understand what you’ve written.

### 5)Quality Assurance
- Evaluating the production machine learning model to ensure quality results
